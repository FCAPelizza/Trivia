I always found trivias to be a funny and very interesting, I really do enjoy watching, listening and reading about some obscure information that was lost in the depths of turbolent ocean that is history. 
That is why I started annoying the hell out of my family with some stupid-ass trivia that only nerds might really care about, it turned into kind of a tradition for us, I told them trivia during dinner in the form of some kind of quiz, they complained because they were dumb or they already knew about them or they were too nerdy for them to know.
Now I will annoy you too, so put on your big boy boots for an very unorganized adventure in the most useless depths of human knowledge.

I will try to cite my sources, but for the old ones I kinda forgot where I british-museum-ed them from, so I will just take credit for those, instead of giving credit to the much more committed and more intelligent people whom I stole those triva from.

Jokes aside, I do hope that you find some of them to be as interesting as I found them to be (which is not too much), if you will ever want to send me one trivia to add to the list please email me at fcapelizza@gmail.com .

Thanks for your kind attention,

Federico Pelizza.
